        Wouldn't time be out to charm you<br>

        Sometimes I need some time...all alone<br>
        Everybody needs some time... on their own<br>
        Don't you know you need some time...all alone<br>

        And shadows still remain, oh Yeah<br>
        I know that you can love me<br>

        lyrics: `I used to rule the world<br>
        Seas would rise when I gave the word<br>
        Now in the morning I sleep alone<br>
        Sweep the streets I used to own<br>
        <br>
        I used to roll the dice<br>
        Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes<br>
        Listened as the crowd would sing,<br>
        &quot;Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!&quot;<br>
        One minute I held the key<br>
        Next the walls were closed on me<br>
        And I discovered that my castles stand<br>
        Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand<br>
        <br>
        I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing<br>
        Roman cavalry choirs are singing<br>
        Be my mirror, my sword and shield<br>
        My missionaries in a foreign field<br>
        For some reason I can't explain<br>
        Once you'd gone there was never<br>
        Never an honest word<br>
        And that was when I ruled the world<br>
        <br>
        It was a wicked and wild wind<br>
        Blew down the doors to let me in<br>
        Shattered windows and the sound of drums<br>
        People couldn't believe what I'd become<br>
        Revolutionaries wait<br>
        For my head on a silver plate<br>
        Just a puppet on a lonely string<br>
        Oh who would ever want to be king?<br>
        <br>
        I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing<br>
        Roman cavalry choirs are singing<br>
        Be my mirror, my sword and shield<br>
        My missionaries in a foreign field<br>
        For some reason I can't explain<br>
        I know St. Peter won't call my name<br>
        Never an honest word<br>
        But that was when I ruled the world<br>
        <br>
        Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh <i>[5x]</i><br>
        <br>
        Hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing<br>
        Roman cavalry choirs are singing<br>
        Be my mirror, my sword and shield<br>
        My missionaries in a foreign field<br>
        For some reason I can't explain<br>
        I know St. Peter won't call my name<br>
        Never an honest word<br>
        But that was when I ruled the world`

        lyrics: `Bust it<br>
        <br>
        This here's a jam for all the fellas<br>
        Trying to do what those ladies tell us<br>
        Get shot down 'cause ya over-zealous<br>
        Play hard to get females get jealous<br>
        <br>
        Okay smarty<br>
        Go to a party<br>
        Girls are scantily clad and showing body<br>
        A chick walks by you wish you could sex her<br>
        But you're standing on the wall like you was Poindexter<br>
        <br>
        Next day's function<br>
        High class luncheon<br>
        Food is served, and you're stone-cold munching<br>
        Music comes on people start to dance<br>
        But then you ate so much you nearly split your pants<br>
        <br>
        A girl starts walking<br>
        Guys start gawking<br>
        Sits down next to you and starts talking<br>
        Says she wants to dance 'cause she likes to groove<br>
        So come on fatso and just bust a move<br>
        <br>
        Just bust a move<br>
        <br>
        You're on a mission and you're wishing<br>
        Someone could cure your lonely condition<br>
        Looking for love in all the wrong places<br>
        No fine girls just ugly faces<br>
        <br>
        From frustration<br>
        First inclination<br>
        Is to become a monk and leave the situation<br>
        But every dark tunnel has a light of hope<br>
        So don't hang yourself with a celibate rope<br>
        <br>
        Now movie's showing,<br>
        So you're going<br>
        Could care less about the five you're blowing<br>
        Theater gets dark just to start the show<br>
        Then ya spot a fine woman sitting in your row<br>
        <br>
        She's dressed in yellow,<br>
        She says &quot;Hello.<br>
        Come sit next to me you fine fellow.&quot;<br>
        You run over there without a second to lose<br>
        And what comes next, hey bust a move<br>
        <br>
        If you want it, you got it<br>
        If you want it, baby, you got it<br>
        (Just bust a move)<br>
        If you want it, you got it<br>
        If you want it, baby, you got it<br>
        <br>
        In this city<br>
        Ladies look pretty<br>
        Guys tell jokes so they can seem witty<br>
        Tell a funny joke just to get some play<br>
        Then you try to make a move and she says, &quot;No way.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Girls are faking<br>
        Goodness saking<br>
        They want a man who brings home the bacon<br>
        Got no money and you got no car<br>
        Then you got no woman and there you are<br>
        <br>
        Some girls are sadistic,<br>
        Materialistic<br>
        Looking for a man makes them opportunistic<br>
        They're lying on a beach perpetrating a tan<br>
        So that a brother with the money can be their man<br>
        <br>
        So on the beach you're strolling<br>
        Real high rolling<br>
        Everything you have is yours and not stolen<br>
        A girl runs up with something to prove<br>
        So don't just stand there, bust a move<br>
        <br>
        If you want it, you got it<br>
        You want it, baby, you got it<br>
        (Just bust a move)<br>
        If you want it, you got it<br>
        You want it, baby, you got it<br>
        (break it down for me fellas)<br>
        <br>
        Your best friend Harry<br>
        Has a brother Larry<br>
        In five days from now he's gonna marry<br>
        He's hoping you can make it there if you can<br>
        'Cause in the ceremony you'll be the best man<br>
        <br>
        You say, &quot;Neat-o,&quot;<br>
        Check your libido<br>
        And roll to the church in your new tuxedo<br>
        The bride walks down just to start the wedding<br>
        And there's one more girl you won't be getting<br>
        <br>
        So you start thinking<br>
        Then you start blinking<br>
        A bridesmaid looks and thinks that you're winking<br>
        She thinks you're kinda cute so she winks back<br>
        And now you're feeling really firm 'cause the girl is stacked<br>
        <br>
        Reception's jumping<br>
        Bass is pumping<br>
        Look at the girl and your heart starts thumping<br>
        Says she wanna dance to a different groove<br>
        Now you know what to do G bust a move<br>
        <br>
        If you want it, you got it<br>
        If you want it, baby, you got it<br>
        (Just bust a move)<br>
        If you want it, you got it<br>
        You want it, baby you got it<br>
        (Move it, boy)`
